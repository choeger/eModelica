eModelica Hacking Howto
=======================

This is a pom-first project built by maven2, to develop on it you will need to

	a) install your eclipse stuff into a (local) maven repository, by using:

	mvn eclipse:to-maven -DstripQualifier=true -DeclipseDir=<YOUR_ECLIPSE_INSTALLATION>

	b) generate a recent .project and .classpath by invoking:

	mvn eclipse:eclipse -Dpde=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DdownloadSources=true

After those steps you can hack on ;)

To build the bundle refer to the file BUILD in the same directory.
