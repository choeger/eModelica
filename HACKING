eModelica Hacking Howto
=======================

This is a pom-first project built by maven2, to develop on it you will need to

	a) install your eclipse stuff into a (local) maven repository, by using:

	mvn eclipse:to-maven -DstripQualifier=true -DeclipseDir=<YOUR_ECLIPSE_INSTALLATION>

	b) generate a recent .project and .classpath by invoking:

	mvn eclipse:eclipse -Dpde=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DdownloadSources=true
	
	c) import the newly generated project into eclipse
	
	d) in the java build path order tab, set the project folder down to the bottom (this is a bug between maven and pde)
	
	e) do not even think of exporting that plugin manually - that is not supported yet

After those steps you can hack on ;)

To build the bundle refer to the file BUILD in the same directory.
